# Scrap Mechanic Casino

This is a website where you can gamble your in-game resources away I made for April Fools 2024. It was playable on https://scrapmechanic.net/casino, and I worked on it for 5 days.

The save file is read in the browser. The die and ground models are game assets converted to a model using [SM-Converter](https://github.com/QuestionableM/SM-Converter).

## How to play

1. Log in with Steam
2. Select a save file to deposit in-game resources for Wonk Credits.
3. Gamble
